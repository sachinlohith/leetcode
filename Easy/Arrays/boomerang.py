Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a
tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the
distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).

Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and
coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).

Example:
Input:
[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]
